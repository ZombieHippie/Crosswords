This is a boilerplate for any website that needs a userdatabase.

We use rehab2 for our client side

I created this project in an effort to create the most comprehensible project heirarchy possible.

## Heirarchy
### Client
The client-side stuff is the only thing that may be different than other boilerplates.

> All static files are generated by using `cake build`

`./src/stylus/<filename>.styl` populates into `./static/css/<filename>.css`

`./src/coffee/` renders into `./static/js/script.js` using *Rehab*

`./vendor/css/*` files are joined and outputted to `./static/css/vendors.css`

`./vendor/js/*` files are joined and outputted to `./static/js/vendors.js`
